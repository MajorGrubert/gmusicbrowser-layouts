(Item Name) for Gaia10.

--
Three years ago a community of active and dedicated users came together to
start a project with the aim to raise awareness for climate change.
How though? The idea was to pick up the visitors at their current vantage point.
And that is the interest in an appealing and innovative interface for their operating system. 

Besides the digital art to customize your PC/Mac, we offer simple and effective
tips and articles to dramatically reduce energy consumption. We are very
glad about the interviews with our Partners from the WWF China and the
responsible company QderoPateo. 

Not only a community project viewed by over 500,000 unique visitors last
year, but also a statement by great musicians who came together to
create the second music release for Gaia.
